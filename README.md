# Chit Chat

A [Matrix](https://matrix.org/) client written with [Jetpack Compose](https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-jb)!

## Usage
Chit-chat is still very experimental and is not ready for general use.
Trying it out right now, would mean getting your hands dirty
and creating the app SQLite database with your credentials,
as login has not been implemented yet.

Open an issue if you're interested in contributing/trying it out.
